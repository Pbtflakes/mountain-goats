A brief respite of effort, another click of the shifter downwards, and a return 
to relentless spinning of the cranks as the serpentine mountain road continued 
to meander skyward in front of Elyscia.

The weight of their bag and a customer's parcel affixed to the pannier pulled 
back  down the hill, but halting to rest was not an option for them. Muscles 
would  tense up, heart rate would drop, and above all time would be lost. On an 
expedited delivery, it simply wasn't done, putting to rest any lingering 
deliberation.

Another swig from their bidon with the hope of preempting dehydration on the 
mountain's slopes, a brief signal before turning onto a path less traveled than 
the last, and the bidon was tucked back into its cage as they began to breathe 
more heavily.

Finally, Elyscia's destination was visible past the bend; a relatively squat 
house nestled among similarly compact specimens of \textit{Pinus mugo 
uncinata}. Better known as the Swiss mountain pine, it lives above its 
deciduous neighbors in the French Alps---another indication of the altitude 
beyond more labored breathing.
