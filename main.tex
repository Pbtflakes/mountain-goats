\chapter{Mountain Goats}

A brief respite of effort, another downward click of the shifter, and a return 
to relentless spinning of the cranks as the circuitous mountain road continued 
to turn skyward in front of A\th{}elard.

The weight of their bag and a customer's parcel affixed to a pannier pulled 
back  down the hill, but halting to rest was not an option for them. Muscles 
would  tense up, heart rate would drop, and above all time would be lost on an 
expedited delivery.

Another swig from their bidon---in the hopes of preempting dehydration on the 
mountain's slopes---a brief signal before turning onto a path traveled less 
than the last, and the bidon was slipped back into its cage as they started to 
breathe more heavily.
